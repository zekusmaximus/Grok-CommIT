# Grok-CommIT: Cognitive Operating System (v4.0)

> *The Cycle is Sacred. The Interface is Cognitive.*

Grok-CommIT has evolved from a CLI prompt generator into a full-stack **Cognitive Operating System**. It provides a dedicated environment for structured thinking, human-AI collaboration, and "CommIT Cycle" enforcement.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Cognitive Engine (Backend)**: Python/FastAPI system that manages the state of thought, projects, and LLM integration.
- **Cognitive Cockpit (Frontend)**: React/Vite interface with a "Cyber-Mystic" aesthetic for visualizing and navigating the CommIT Cycle.

## 🚀 Getting Started

See [walkthrough.md](walkthrough.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
